Dear reader,
My name is Francisco Chicharro (frachilo@upv.es). Here you will find a set of programs for Matlab to generate dynamical planes. If you use this code for your publication, I would be grateful if you could cite the work in which it is published: [reference].
A short explanation about the files:
> Generation of the dynamical planes
>> dynPlane.m for generating dynamical planes from iterative methods for solving nonlinear equations: Newton, Steffensen, ...
>> dynPlaneMemo.m for generating dynamical planes coming from iterative methods with memory: Secant, ...
>> dynPlaneSystem.m for generating dynamical planes from iterative methods for solving nonlinear systems: Newton, ...
> Representation of the dynamical planes: the output Z of the previous files is the input of
>> plotDynPlane.m
There is an additional file "Examples of use.mlx" that will help you how to proceed with the generation and representation of the dynamical planes.
Good luck!

Disclaimer. The code is alive; note the updates at the bottom of the document.
